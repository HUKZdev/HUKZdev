# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi, I’m **Oleh** – a Computer Science student at **Kent State University**.

I’m currently learning and building in:
- **Game programming** (Godot, Unity, modding tools)
- **Cybersecurity** (reverse engineering, exploits, systems)
- **C#**, **C++**, **Python**, and exploring **GDScript**
- Linux (Pop!_OS / Debian), Windows 10 (main OS), Git, and home server setups

Outside of tech, I’m into music, horror movies, electronics, and weird audio experiments.

I also work part-time in retail while leveling up my dev skills.

# Current Focus
- Learning **Object-Oriented Programming** (freeCodeCamp + university)
- Writing tools/scripts in **Python**, **C#** and **C++**
- Building game prototypes in **Godot Engine** and **Unity**
- Studying **networking, exploits, and system security**

# Projects

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fernwick** | A RPG fantasy about a nap loving wizard *(in development)* |
| **In the Name of Sabbath** | Boomer Shooter (specifically DUSK) inspired game, with atmosphere of New Orleans and their music scene *(concept stage)* |
| **Home Server Project** | Custom home server built on an old laptop running **Debian 12** – includes Samba and Docker with Navidrome, File Browser, Gitea and Code Server. Built to explore system fundamentals, bash scripting, and most importantly to have a fun time. All due on limited hardware. |

> More projects coming soon – currently balancing school, work, and solo dev time.

# Home Server Setup (Details)

A personal project to learn Linux and home networking using an old laptop:

- OS: **Debian 12**
- Hardware: **ASUS X551MA** with an **Intel Celeron N2830 (dual-core)** and **4GB RAM**
- Services: **Samba**, SSH access, and utility scripts
- Configs: Mounted drives, file permissions, CLI navigation
- Storage: ~450GB ext4 drive
- Why: To learn system maintenance, service management, and Linux-based file sharing

> The fact it runs smoothly on old hardware proves you don’t need a high-end machine to start learning system administration.
> Cleaned and sanitized config samples available soon in separate repo
